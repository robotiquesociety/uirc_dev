                          Robotique Society was established on March 12, 2014 by
                          a couple of University Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia France
                          Institute students who are passionate and dedicated
                          into Robotics. Most of the founder was an engineering
                          student who are major in Mechatronics, Industrial
                          Automation and Robotics.This association began to turn
                          on its first participation at the national level,
                          RobotWar Competition in UNITEN. Robotique Society is
                          active in robotic competitions throughout the country.
                          In addition, the association also organizes seminars
                          and workshops that involve engineering skills such as
                          software, hardware and other skills like Programming
                          Workshop and Circuit Designing Workshop.
